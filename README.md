# Deep Learning | Image Binary Classification Model using Intel OpenVino Toolkit
This repository is part of my final Bachelor´s Degree project. The idea is about take some images with damaged or not areas and identify which one of these owns each category (damaged,undamaged).

The main goal is to implement this neural network in Intel´s devices. Hence, we will use the [OpenVino Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) to obtain a multiplatform and optimize model in Intel´s hardware.
## Neural Network
## Installation
### Requirements
- I´m using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as my development environment. If you want to open the notebook, you have to have installed [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) in your system.
- OS: Windows 10 Home
- Python 3.7.4 64-bits
- OpenVino 2019 R3.1
