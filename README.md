# **Deep Learning | Image Binary Classification Model using Intel OpenVino Toolkit**
This repository is part of my final Bachelor´s Degree project. The idea is about take some images with damaged or not areas and identify which one of these owns each category (damaged,undamaged).

The main goal is to implement this neural network in Intel´s devices. Hence, we will use the [OpenVino Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) to obtain a multiplatform and optimize model to be used in Intel´s hardware.
## **Neural Network**
The NN is deployed in Keras by [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf) using Python. The version of Tensorflow is **2.0** for development, but for OpenVino, the **v1.15** is needed (check the rest of tools and dependencies in OpenVino´s web). This model is formed by the next layers:
