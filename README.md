# Deep Learning | Image Binary Classification Model using Intel OpenVino Toolkit
This repository is part of my final Bachelor´s Degree project. The idea is about take some images with damaged or not areas and identify which one of these owns each class (damaged,undamaged).

The main goal is to implement this neural network in Intel´s devices. Hence, we will use the OpenVino Toolkit to obtain a multiplatform and optimize model.
