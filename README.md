# **Deep Learning | Image Binary Classification Model using Intel OpenVino Toolkit**
This repository is part of my end-of-degree´s project. The idea is about take some images with damaged or not areas and identify which one of these owns each category (damaged,undamaged).

As an example, the images have this view:

![kitten](damaged/post_064_056.png "Damaged")
![kitten](damaged/post_061_096.png "Damaged")
![kitten](undamaged/post_006_127.png "Undamaged")
![kitten](undamaged/post_007_094.png "Undamaged")

The main goal is to implement this neural network in Intel´s devices. Hence, we will use the [OpenVino Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) to obtain a multiplatform and optimized model to be used in Intel´s hardware.
## **Neural Network**
The NN is deployed in Keras by [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf) using Python. The version of Tensorflow is **2.0** for development, but for OpenVino, the **v1.15** is needed (check the rest of tools and dependencies in OpenVino´s web). This model is formed by the next layers:
